## Scrum-Poker Web Application

## Scrum-Poker: An Overview

Scrum-Poker, also known as Planning Poker, is a consensus-based Agile planning and estimating technique. Team members use physical cards resembling playing cards to estimate the effort needed to complete each task or story in a sprint. This app facilitates the process in a real-time collaborative environment, thanks to WebSockets.

## WebSocket Communication

The application establishes a WebSocket connection to the server using the URL `ws://localhost:8000/ws`. This WebSocket allows real-time communication between the client and the server, enabling instant data updates.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.6.

## Technologies Used

- Angular v16.1.6
- Angular Material v16.1.6
- Tailwind CSS v3.3.3

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   git clone <url>
   Using https: https://github.com/deepakjtrigent/scrum_poker.git
   Using ssh: git@github.com:deepakjtrigent/scrum_poker.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd scrum_poker/FE

3. Install the dependencies using npm:
   npm install

4. Start the development server:
   ng serve

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:4200` to access the application.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
